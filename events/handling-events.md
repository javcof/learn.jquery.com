### Handling Events
jQuery provides a method `.on()` to respond to any event on the seleted elements. This is called an *event binding*.
Although `.on()` isn't the only method provided for binding, it is a best practice to use this for jQuery 1.7+. To learn more, [read more about the evolution of event binding in jQuery](#)

The `.on()` method provides several useful features:

* [Bind any event tiggered on the selected elements to an event handler](#)
* [Bind multiple events to one event handler](#)
* [Bind multiple events and multiple handlers to the selected elements](#)
* [Use details about the event in the event handlers](#)
* [Pass data to the event handler for custom Events](#)
* [Bind events to elements that will be rendered in the future](#)
