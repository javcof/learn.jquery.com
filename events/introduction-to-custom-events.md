### Custom Events
We're all familiar the basic events - click, mouseover, focus, blur, submit, etc. that we can latch on to as a user interacts with browser. Custom events open up a whole new world of event-driven programming.

* Behaviors of the target element can easily be triggerd by different elements using the same code.
* Behaviors can be triggered across multiple, similar, target elements at once.
* Behaviors are more clearly associated with the target element in code, making code easier to read and maintain.
