### Events
jQuery provides simple methods for attaching event handlers to selections. When an event occurs, the provided function is executed. Inside the function, `this` refers to the DOM element that initiated the event.

For details on jQuery events, visit the [Event documentation on api.jquery.com](http://api.jquery.com/category/events/)

The event handling function can receive and event object. This object can be used to determine the nature of the event, and to prevent the event's default behavior.
