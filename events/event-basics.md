### jQuery Event Basics
Setting Up Event Responses on DOM Elements

jQuery makes it straightforward to set up event-driven responses on page elements. There events are often triggered by the end user's interaction with the page, such as when text is entered into a form element or the mouse pointer is moved. In some cases, such as the page load and unload events, the browser itself will trigger the event.

jQuery offers convenience methods for most native browser events. There methods including `.click`, `.focus()`, `.blue()`, `.change()`, etc. are shorthand for jQuery's `.on()` method.
